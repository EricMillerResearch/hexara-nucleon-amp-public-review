# Limitations

This package should be interpreted as simulation-backed engineering evidence only.

## Not Yet Complete

- Frozen production schematic values/tolerances
- Final PCB layout manufacturing outputs (Gerbers/ODB++, drill, pick/place)
- Final BOM lifecycle/alternates validation
- Firmware production package and programming process
- Compliance pre-scan and formal certification artifacts
- Full thermal/mechanical validation on physical hardware

## Interpretation Boundaries

- Do not treat these files as proof of certified safety/compliance.
- Do not treat simulation-only outputs as guaranteed hardware performance.
- Use this package as a review baseline and reproducible methods set.
