# Peer Review Checklist

## Scope and Claims

- [ ] Scope is explicitly simulation/engineering draft.
- [ ] Claims do not imply production readiness or certification.
- [ ] Limitations are clearly documented.

## Reproducibility

- [ ] Reviewer can run the core suite from documented steps.
- [ ] Output artifacts are generated in documented paths.
- [ ] Report values are traceable to generated files.

## Technical Soundness

- [ ] Test suite covers load step, rail sag, low impedance, clipping recovery, thermal foldback, and THD sweep.
- [ ] Measurement extraction is scripted.
- [ ] Risk conditions are visible, not hidden.

## Handoff Quality

- [ ] Open engineering gaps are listed.
- [ ] Files needed for future hardware release are identified.
- [ ] Risk register and compliance planning are present.
